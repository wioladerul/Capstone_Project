Here is our repository for the Bangkit 2024 Capstone project - Machine Learning.

## Description
Teknisiku is a practical solution for students and general public to find nearby and credible laptop service locations. The application provides detailed information about service locations, distance, ratings, and reviews. With a simple and user-friendly interface. Teknisiku aims to simplify the device repair process and support the economic empowerment of service providers.

## Method

## Tools
- Python
- Sklearn
- Math
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
## Dataset
We made the dataset from scratch by specifying the variables manually in Excel. We created 3 datasets, Model Dataset, Service Dataset, and General Solution Dataset. Variables for the Model Dataset are Nama Tempat, Longitude, Latitude, rating. The explanation of each variable is as follows :
- Nama Tempat : Names of laptop/computer repair shops that will be available on the app from the cities of Surabaya, Yogyakarta, and Solo.
- Longitude : The longitude location of each laptop/computer service center.
- Latitude : The latitude location of each laptop/computer service center.
- Rating : Ratings for the service place or technician of the laptop/computer service place from users who have used the service.

The variables for the Service Dataset are Nama Tempat, Foto, Deskripsi, Longitude, Latitude, No Telp, Rating, dan Ulasan. The explanation of each variable is as follows :
- Nama Tempat : Names of laptop/computer repair shops that will be available on the app from the cities of Surabaya, Yogyakarta, and Solo.
- Foto : Photos of each laptop/computer service center.
- Deskripsi : Description of each existing laptop/computer service center.
- Longitude : The longitude location of each laptop/computer service center.
- Latitude :  The latitude location of each laptop/computer service center.
- No Telp : Phone number of each existing laptop/computer service center.
- Rating : Ratings for the service place or technician of the laptop/computer service place from users who have used the service.
- Ulasan : Reviews for the service center or technicians of the service center from users who have used the service.

The variables for the General Solution Dataset are Masalah and Solusi. The explanation of each variable is as follows:
- Masalah : Common problems that usually occur with laptops/computers.
- Solusi : General solutions / tips to handle every common laptop/computer problem.

We use the Model Dataset to build the model, while the Service Dataset and General Solution Dataset will be used by the cloud computing team to create an application database.
