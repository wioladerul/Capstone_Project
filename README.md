## Dataset
We made the dataset from scratch by specifying the variables manually in Excel. We created 3 datasets, Model Dataset, Service Dataset, and General Solution Dataset. Variables for the model dataset are Nama Tempat, Longitude, Latitude, rating. The explanation of each variable is as follows :
- Nama Tempat : Names of laptop/computer repair shops that will be available on the app from the cities of Surabaya, Yogyakarta, and Solo.
- Longitude : The longitude location of each laptop/computer service center.
- Latitude : The latitude location of each laptop/computer service center.
- Rating : Ratings for the service place or technician of the laptop/computer service place from users who have used the service.

The variables for the service dataset are Nama Tempat, Foto, Deskripsi, Longitude, Latitude, No Telp, Rating, dan Ulasan. The explanation of each variable is as follows :
- Nama Tempat : Names of laptop/computer repair shops that will be available on the app from the cities of Surabaya, Yogyakarta, and Solo.
- Foto : Photos of each laptop/computer service center.
- Deskripsi : Description of each existing laptop/computer service center.
- Longitude : The longitude location of each laptop/computer service center.
- Latitude :  The latitude location of each laptop/computer service center.
- No Telp : Phone number of each existing laptop/computer service center.
- Rating : Ratings for the service place or technician of the laptop/computer service place from users who have used the service.
- Ulasan : Reviews for the service center or technicians of the service center from users who have used the service.
